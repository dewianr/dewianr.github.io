# Breast Cancer Classification: Comparing Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression 
This project aims to classify breast cancer data using three popular machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. The dataset used in this project is the breast cancer dataset available from scikit-learn, which contains features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies. The goal is to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant based on these features. In this project, various preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and model evaluation metrics are employed to optimize the performance of each algorithm. Through this project, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of each model and select the best-performing algorithm for the classification task.
# Background
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide with the number of cases reaching 2.3 million cases each year (WHO, 2023). Early detection of breast cancer can increase survival up to 90% (Kemkes.go.id). The biggest challenge in this breast cancer case is the limited access to fast and accurate diagnostic methods. Machine Learning is a tool that helps identify malignant and benign tumors with high accuracy and can support early detection efficiently.
# Workflow
1. **Load Dataset**  Retrieve the breast cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn. 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  Understand data structure, class distribution, and feature correlation.
3. **Data Preprocessing**  Standardize data and split into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**  Build models using Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
5. **Model Evaluation**  Assess performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
6. **Conclusion**  Compare models to determine the best-performing one.
# Tools and Libraries
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model building and evaluation.
# Conclusion
- Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (98.25%), followed by Random Forest (96.49%) and SVM (94.74%).
- All models performed well, but Logistic Regression proved to be the best in this case.
- The results show that machine learning can effectively aid in breast cancer diagnosis.
- Future improvements could involve using more advanced models and larger datasets.
